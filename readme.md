Turtle JS is an online platform to teach kids between the age of 11 - 14 simple programming logic using the Javascript language. After completing this tutorial the kids should have enough knowledge in computing to be able to understand and implement the Bubblesort Sorting Algorithm. The teaching material will thus cover the basics of a programming language and be shown to the kids in the most interactive way possible. The teaching material was made from scratch by our team members and follows the story of Loid the tortoise racing against his vicious friend Paul the Hare. Each video is an exercise in the form of a story. The goal is to make the exercise as appealing as possible for the kids by giving a purpose to each exercise: help the tortoise win the race.

This project was done for a UCL CS Y1 coursework. Aim was to teach coding to kids.
